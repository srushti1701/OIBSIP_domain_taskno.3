Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning is a data science project that predicts the selling price of a car based on various features such as brand, year, mileage, engine power, fuel type, and transmission. The project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical car data and build a predictive model that estimates car prices accurately

The price of a car depends on several factors such as brand value, manufacturing year, mileage, engine power, and fuel type. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on these features. It is a practical example of applying regression models to real-world data.

## Objectives fulfilled through the project: 
- Analyze car price dataset
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
- Build a machine learning regression model
- Predict car prices based on input features
- Evaluate model performance

## Datasets we are using the project Contains information about cars such as:
  - Brand
  - Model year
  - Mileage
  - Fuel type
  - Transmission
  - Engine capacity
  - Selling price


## Tools & Technologies
